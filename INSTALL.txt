ROADMAP

There will be an install profile when the tool gets to a release version,
but basically you'll turn on features for the data wiki and 
this should turn on the settings that you need.


FEATURES
Datawiki Resources (Drupal settings)
Devel Resources (Developer tools for managing the site)
Web Resource (Main resource type - setups up most of the fields that all other types would use)
Mailing List
